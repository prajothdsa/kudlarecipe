		<key>Urad Dal Bonda (Biscuit Ambade)</key>
		<string>Urad Dal Bonda | Biskut Ambade Recipe

Ingredients

Split black gram lentils (urad dal) ≠ 1 cup
Green chillies≠ 3 nos.
Salt≠ 1 tsp
Curry leaves≠ Few
Chopped coconut≠ Handful(optional)
Medium rava/sooji≠ 3 tsp
Cooking oil≠ Enough to deep fry the bonda.

Method 

Soak black gram lentils in enough water for about 2 hours.
Rinse the lentils with enough water, drain and then grind it with salt and green chillies to
smooth, fluffy and thick batter. You can add 1/4 cup of water little by little while grinding but
don&apos;t ever add too much water. The batter consistency is very very important to make the
perfect bonda. You can use either mixer or wet grinder for grinding the lentils.
Transfer the batter in to a wide bowl and add sooji, chopped curry leaves and coconut pieces.
Combine everything well with your fingers. At this stage you can check whether it is of dropping
consistency or not. If you feel the batter is bit runny, then add some more rava to it.
Heat a wok adding enough cooking oil, when the oil heats up carefully drop a lemon sized batter
using your hand. Deep fry them in medium flame till they turn golden brown. Once done,
remove from oil using slotted ladle and drain on kitchen tissue paper.
Repeat the process of deep frying the bondas with rest of the batter.
Ural dal bondas are ready to serve as tea time snack. These are crispy from outside and soft
from inside.
Batter consistency is very very important to make perfect urad dal bondas. So be careful while
adding water to grind the lentils. If you add too less then bondas turn hard on the other hand if
you add more you cannot shape the bondas and they drink lots of oil.
Do not add all the water at once to grind the lentils. Add little at a time.
Use of wet grinder is recommended to blend the black gram lentils but I used my mixer grinder
itself.
You can skip adding coconut pieces. I like the bites of coconut which adds extra crunch to the
bonda while eating.
You can add chopped green chillies instead of grinding it together with urad dal.

		<key>Thin Rice Flakes Mixture</key>
		<string>Thin Rice Flakes Mixture  Thin Rice Flakes Chiwda Recipe

Ingredients

Thin rice flakes≠ 1/2 kg
Peanuts≠ 1/4 cup
Roasted gram≠ 1/4 cup
Copra pieces≠ Handful
Salt≠ 1 tsp
Red chilly powder≠ 1 tsp
Turmeric powder≠ 1/2 tsp
Sugar≠ 2 tsp
Curry leaves≠ few
Garlic crushed≠ 3 to 4 nos.(optional)
Mustard seeds≠ 1 tsp
Cooking oil≠ 1/4 cup


Instructions


Spread the thin rice flakes on a paper and sun dry it for at least 3 hours till the flakes are crisp. If
it&apos;s not a sunny day, then you can spread the flakes over a warm griddle for some time.
Heat a wide wok with cooking oil and mustard seeds, as the seeds crackle mix in curryleaves,
copra pieces, crushed garlic and peanuts. Saute till the peanuts are roasted well. Next include
roasted gram. Saute for 10 seconds.
Next it is time to include all the spices like turmeric powder, red chilly powder and salt. Combine
everything well and put off the flame.
With flame turned off, add rice flakes and sugar. Stir and combine the flakes with seasoning till
the spices get coated over them.
Let the flakes rest in the warm wok itself for some time which helps the beaten rice to be very
crisp and crunch. Then store it in airtight container and relish with tea.
Sun drying the rice flakes always result in very brittle and crisp mixture. So do not skip it.
I would suggest adding roasted gram to the seasoning only after the peanuts get fried.
Do not over≠cook the seasoning after adding roasted gram because roasted gram turns brown
immediately and taste bitter.
You can skip adding garlic and can include some cashews too for extra yumminess.
I would suggest adding sugar at the end along with rice flakes because sugar forms lump in the
seasoning.
Combining rice flakes with seasoning should be done off the stove to avoid wilting.

Pour two tablespoons of cooking oil in a cooking vessel large enough to hold the Suran pieces, and heat it. Fry the mustard  kept for seasoning. Put the masala in the oil when the mustard seeds have stopped spluttering and fry it. Then add the Suran pieces after removing them from the  water.    The liquid in the vessel should be a little above the Suran pieces. As they get cooked, the will expand in size. The water will be absorbed, and you should watch that it does not dry, and the contents get burnt. So add some water if needed, till the Suran pieces are cooked. When they are done, the dish should be more or less dry. Taste and make adjustments if needed and when the Suran pieces are cooked, add the coconut kept for garnishing. Put the stove off, and cover it with its lid. As it cools, more moisture will be absorbed by the Suran pieces and the dish will be a dry one.

Suran contain iron, and are a good source of nutrients. Any vegetable that contains iron, turns black when kept out, without its natural cover, the skin.</string>
